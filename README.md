Products such as the Apple TV 4K, while achieving moderate revenue ($33.33 million), contribute minimally to profit ($11.72 million), 
highlighting areas for strategic realignment or cost reduction efforts. Conversely, flagship devices like the MacBook Pro not only 
drive revenue but also deliver the highest margins, emphasizing their importance in Appleâ€™s portfolio.

Shipment Efficiency: Replicate the operational successes of 2022 by streamlining supply chain processes to maintain faster delivery times globally.
Address shipment inconsistencies, as observed in the anomaly of negative shipment days, to ensure consistent customer experiences.

Product Strategy:
Prioritize investments in high-margin products like MacBook Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.
Evaluate the cost structures of lower-margin items, such as the Apple TV 4K, to improve overall profitability.

Inventory Management:
Optimize stock levels for best-selling items like iPad Pro to avoid supply shortages.
Implement predictive analytics to align inventory with demand across regions and product types.
